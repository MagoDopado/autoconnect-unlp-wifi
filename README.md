autoconnect-unlp-wifi
=====================

I'm a bash script wich keeps you logged in UNLP's WiFi network, saving you from:
- having to log in all the time
- writing internet-internet all the time
- being unhappy


Dependencies:
-------------
- curl


Pre:
----
The files run-auto-connect, kill-auto-connect and auto-connect.sh must be in the same directory.


How to:
-------
Run run-auto-connect to run the script and keep it running in background and without the need of an active terminal.
Run kill-auto-connect to kill the background running the script.
You can run both by executing them in a terminal or by double clicking them and choosing "Run" instead of "Run in a terminal".
